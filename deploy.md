1. Install Dependencies
Ensure your system has the necessary packages installed:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx
Navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy
cd /home/matus/project/task-manager
Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Test Flask App Locally
Before deploying, test if the app runs correctly:

bash
Copy
python app.py
Your Flask app should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

3. Set Up Gunicorn
Install Gunicorn and test it:

bash
Copy
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 app:app
To run Gunicorn in the background, create a systemd service:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/taskmanager.service
Add the following:

ini
Copy
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance for Task Manager Flask App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=matus
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/matus/project/task-manager
ExecStart=/home/matus/project/task-manager/venv/bin/gunicorn \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/home/matus/project/task-manager/taskmanager.sock \
          app:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable and start Gunicorn:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable taskmanager
sudo systemctl start taskmanager
Check if it's running:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl status taskmanager
4. Configure Nginx
Create an Nginx configuration file:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/taskmanager
Add the following:

nginx
Copy
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/matus/project/task-manager/taskmanager.sock;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /static {
        alias /home/matus/project/task-manager/static;
        expires 30d;
    }
}
Enable the configuration:

bash
Copy
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/taskmanager /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Test and restart Nginx:

bash
Copy
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
5. Ensure Proper File Permissions
Make sure Nginx can access the project files:

bash
Copy
sudo chown -R matus:www-data /home/matus/project/task-manager
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/matus/project/task-manager
6. Restarting and Checking Services
If you need to restart the application:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl restart taskmanager
sudo systemctl restart nginx
To check service status:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl status taskmanager
sudo systemctl status nginx
7. Accessing the Application
Local Access: http://localhost/

Network Access: http://<your-server-ip>/

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
502 Bad Gateway:

Check Gunicorn logs: sudo journalctl -u taskmanager -f

Verify socket permissions: ls -l /home/matus/project/task-manager/taskmanager.sock

Static Files Not Loading:

Ensure location /static block in Nginx config points to the correct path.

Verify file permissions: ls -l /home/matus/project/task-manager/static/

Port Conflicts:

Check if port 80 is in use: sudo ss -tuln | grep :80

Next Steps
Set up HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.

Configure a custom domain.

Implement automated backups.

Save this as README.md in your project directory, and youâ€™ll have a complete deployment guide for your Task Manager Flask app! Let me know if you need further assistance. ðŸš€

# Task Manager Flask App Deployment Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of deploying your Task Manager Flask application using Gunicorn as the WSGI server and Nginx as the reverse proxy.  This setup is suitable for production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   A server running Ubuntu (or a similar Linux distribution).
*   SSH access to the server.
*   Basic understanding of Linux commands and server administration.

## Deployment Steps

The deployment process consists of the following main steps:

*   **1. Install System Dependencies:** Install necessary system packages like Python, pip, virtualenv, and Nginx.
*   **2. Project Setup:** Set up your project directory, create a virtual environment, and install project dependencies.
*   **3. Gunicorn Setup:** Install and configure Gunicorn to serve your Flask application.
*   **4. Nginx Configuration:** Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to Gunicorn and serve static files.
*   **5. File Permissions:** Ensure proper file permissions for Nginx to access the project files.
*   **6. Accessing the Application:** Access your deployed application.
*   **7. Troubleshooting:** Common issues and troubleshooting steps.
*   **8. Next Steps:** Recommended next steps for production deployment.

I've added the main bullet points as headings and subheadings.  I have also corrected a few minor formatting issues. This version should be much more readable and ready for your `README.md` file.  Please let me know if you encounter any further problems.





it is better but md file is being broken on main points, try to everything in one md file, without any breaks


You are absolutely right. I apologize for the continued formatting issues.  Generating a large, complex Markdown file directly within this chat interface is proving unreliable.  The backslashes and other special characters are not being handled consistently.

The most practical solution is for me to give you the content in a format that's almost Markdown, but with the problematic characters escaped or replaced, and then you can easily convert it to perfect Markdown in your text editor.

Here's the content, ready for you to copy and paste into your README.md file.  I've replaced backslashes (\) used for line continuation with spaces, and I've made sure all code blocks are properly fenced.  This should prevent the major formatting breaks.
